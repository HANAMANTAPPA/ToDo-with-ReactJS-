## 1st part- UI design
   * Main App component
   * TodoListComponent --
       Inside the component 
       - added the main container where all content will be shown. 
       - added Input container for taking the input task or ToDo. 
       - added task counter for showing number of tasks on the screen. 
       - unodered list for addeding along with delete botton 

## 2nd Part - Functionality (In scope)
   - Fetch TODO or task
   - Add a TODO or Task
   - Delete a TODO or Taks
   - Toggle task check or uncheck
   - total items count 
## Functions (In scope)

## Functions out of scope (I'll implement in upcoming days)
